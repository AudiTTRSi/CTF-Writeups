Advent of Cyber is now regular seasonal room on <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackMe</a> page.
This is their 4th time and again with awsome story to follow each day's assignment.

Here are my solutions for the Day 7, if anyone gets stuck.

Firstly start the VM that is attached to the task, for me it took about 2 or 3 minutes that machine booted up.
Today's task is pretty easy just follow step by step instructions provided in the task description and you will have answers in few minutes.<br>
After machine booted up you open the FF browser and open cyberchef bookmark.
