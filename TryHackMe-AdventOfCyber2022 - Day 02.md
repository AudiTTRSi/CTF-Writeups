Advent of Cyber is now regular seasonal room on <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackMe</a> page.
This is their 4th time and again with awsome story to follow each day's assignment.

Here are my solutions for the Day 2, if anyone gets stuck.

<ol>

  <li><b>Q2</b></li><br>
  To answer this use <blockquote>ls</blockquote> command on home folder
  <li><b>Q3</b></li><br>
  With previous command you answer the Q3.

  <li><b>Q5</b></li><br>
  Display server log file in console where you see dates and check the week day and you can answer the question.
  <li><b>Q6</b></li><br>
  With displaying the server log file we can see that logs contains only one IP address.
  <li><b>Q7</b></li><br>
  <blockquote>grep -v 404 webserver.log</blockquote> To display all lines that does not include 404 requests and see only succesful ones and you can then easly see 
  <li><b>Q8</b></li><br>
  <blockquote>grep -i THM *.log</blockquote><br>
  grep through all log files in folder to find the flag.

</ol>

I hope anyone finds it usefull
