Advent of Cyber is now regular seasonal room on <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackMe</a> page.
This is their 4th time and again with awsome story to follow each day's assignment.

Here are my solutions for the Day 4, if anyone gets stuck.

<ol>

  <li><b>Q1 & Q2</b></li><br>
To answer first 2 questions you can use following command:
  <blockquote><b>nmap -sV [IP of attack VM ]</b></blockquote>

  <li><b>Q3 & Q4</b></li><br>
For answering Q3 and Q4 you need to connect to samba share.<br>
To do that you open file explorer and enter <b>smb://IP_of_samba_share</b> and click on the admins folder and login with credentials provided in task.

</ol>


I hope anyone who gets stuck finds it helpful<br>
